## About

Welcome to Something Stochastic - a blog that is good, _occassionally poor_. My name is Dominik Kiersz - you can find more about me, CV and contact details in the **Author** menu.

Established in 2022 (and daydreamed since 2018), I hope this blog will allow me to share my often erractic passion for tech and misceleious engineering. You can find the whole list of posts in **Blog** menu.

This website was written powered by Hugo Single-Site Generator (SSG) and designed by me using the Bootstrap 5.2 framework. The logo has been designed by Bethan Iley.
