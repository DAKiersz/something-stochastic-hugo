A blog that is good, _occasionally poor_.

Established in 2023, this blog allows me to share my often erratic passion for tech and miscellaneous engineering. You can find the whole list of posts in **Blog** menu.

You can find my front-page on [kiersz.dev](https://kiersz.dev/) and contact me via email: [dakiersz.ucudk@8shield.net](mailto:dakiersz.ucudk@8shield.net)

This website was written powered by Hugo Single-Site Generator (SSG) and designed by me using the CSS with the Bootstrap framework (v5.30+). 

The logo has been kindly created by Bethan Iley.
