A blog that is good, _occassionally poor_.

Established in 2023, this blog allows me to share my often erractic passion for tech and miscellaneous engineering. You can find the whole list of posts in **Blog** menu.

This website was written powered by Hugo Single-Site Generator (SSG) and designed by me using the CSS and Bootstrap 5.3 framework. The logo has been kindly created by Bethan Iley.

You can find my frontpage on kiersz.dev and contact me via email:
