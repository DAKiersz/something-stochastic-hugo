A blog that is good, _occassionally poor_.

Established in 2023, this blog allows me to share my often erractic passion for tech and miscellaneous engineering. You can find the whole list of posts in **Blog** menu.

You can find my frontpage on kiersz.dev and contact me via email: TBD

This website was written powered by Hugo Single-Site Generator (SSG) and designed by me using the CSS and Bootstrap framework (v5.30+). The logo has been kindly created by Bethan Iley.
