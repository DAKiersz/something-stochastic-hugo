Hello World! This is my first post on Something Stochastic, my personal tech blog that aims to be good, _occassionally poor_.

## Why bother?

If you scroll with LinkedIn you might find a questionale post or two about how people don't like selling themselves, that we need to do better because of how more often than not we end up deflecting complements it with a self-deprecating counter-comment. I found there is a truth to tham, and I'm just a guilty in this.

Over last few years, I've spend time on a dozen or so misceleneous mini-projects - from refrubruishing laptops, using ADB-S receivers for aircraft tracking or more recently developing home infrastructure (more info soon!). I've dabbled in DXing, Linux and more academic subjects like probability theory to contributing on academic projects, baside a number of personal adventuares. But how do you know that I've done any of that? **You don't** and this is where this blog will hopefully step in.

In short, this blog will aid me in sharing my thoughts on various topics related to tech and enginnering, but also serve as a noble platform the shameless self-promotion ranging from my experiences, to right up-to my current passion projects - including this very blog, and painstankly learning WebDev to develop it.

## Something Stochastic?

Like with a lot of projects, it took ages to come up with this name. The original idea was to create a joint blog with my partner that would span a range of topics: from astronomy, computer engineering from my side to topic she specialises in like psychology or sustainability. Now, from physics a stochastic process is one inherently random, usually associated with motion of gas particles. We can ascribe mathematical relations to such processes to describe how

This is 3rd iteration of this Hugo blog.

## What's next?

This does not aim to be a regular blog, but rather a curated collection of my activities and things I've learned over the years. 

I also set myself a goal of making a single video to showcase my homelab, and more importantly the process of creating it.
