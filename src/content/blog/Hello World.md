Hello World! This is my first post on Something Stochastic, my personal tech blog that aims to be good, _occasionally poor_.

## Why bother?

If you scroll with LinkedIn, you might find a questionable post or two about how people don't like selling themselves, that we all need to do better because we end up deflecting complements with self-deprecating counter-comments instead. I found there is a truth to them - and I'm just as guilty of this.

Over last few years, I've spent time on a dozen or so miscellaneous mini-projects - from refurbishing laptops, using ADB-S receivers for aircraft tracking to developing home infrastructure (more info soon!). I've also dabbled in DXing, Linux and probability theory in order to contribute in academic projects, besides a number of personal adventures. One thing missing is a platform to showcase it all, really.

In short, this blog will aid me in sharing my thoughts on various topics related to tech and engineering; but also serve as a noble platform for shameless self-promotion and showcasing current passion projects - including this very blog, and the painstaking process of learning WebDev to develop it.

## Something Stochastic?

Like with a lot of projects, it took ages to come up with this name. The original idea was to create a joint blog with my partner that would span a range of topics. I would focus on astronomy and computer engineering, whereas she would specialize in psychology or sustainability. In essence, a random but vaguely academic and technophilic blog.

From the world of physics (and probability theorem), a **stochastic** process is one inherently random and unpredicable. It is often used to describe physical behaviours of systems that are subject to fluctuations, chaos or other random variables. In thermodynamics, we can ascribe mathematical equations known as Equations of State (EoS) that describe the average behaviour of gas (or other substances). For example, particle velocities in a volume of gas that are proportional to temperature. The simplest EoS of ithe Ideal Gas Equation, which assumes that movement of particles is inherently random, and therefore stochastic.

Wikipedia also defines stochastic as a property described by a random probability distribution. This makes sense in our example, as the of velocities of particles are also defined by a distribution. In essence, as we cannot predict velocities of individual gas particles. Observable macroscopic behaviour of gases, such as pressure and temperature, can be described by statistical averages of those distributions for large numbers of particles.

This blog aimed (and still does) to be stochastic - but mostly centred around tech and science, akin to a distribution. We ultimately decided to start our own projects instead, with me inheriting the first iteration of this website that this version swiftly moved from. The name stuck and is still correct for stuff that will be written here.

## Design

This is a 3rd iteration of this blog, this one being vaguely functional and written in Hugo. I will make a separate post about learning ins and outs, but the primary morale of this journey can be summarised: 

* WebDev is painful.
* I prefer setting up infrastructure for projects like this.
* **Do not over-engineer your websites**. My other website, [kiersz.dev](https://kiersz.dev), is a single static page with some links uploaded to Porkbun's hosting. It does its job, just like this blog will hosted on Azure.

## What's next?

This does not intend to be a regular blog, but rather a curated collection of my activities and things I've learned over the years. 

I also set myself a goal of making a single video to showcase my homelab, and more importantly, the process of creating it.

Thanks for reading!
