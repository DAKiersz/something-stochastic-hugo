  <h4 class="text-center m-3">A blog that is good, <i>occasionally poor...</i></h4>
  <p class="text-center"> Established in 2023, this blog allows me to share my often erratic passion for tech and
    miscellaneous engineering.
    <strong>You can find the whole list of posts in Blog menu. </strong> The
    <strong>Vault</strong> links to my non-production Obsidian repository for the public domain, containing
    boilerplates and a general knowledge base. It's <a href="https://gitlab.com/dakiersz-group/obsidian-dak-public"
      class="inline-link" target="_blank"><strong>hosted</strong> on GitLab Pages.

      <p class="text-center">This website was written powered by Hugo Single-Site Generator (SSG) and designed by myself
        (with great
        difficulty!) using CSS with the Bootstrap framework (=>5.30). The brand logo has been kindly created by <a
