    <p>Hello World! This is my first post on Something Stochastic, my personal tech blog that aims to be good, <em>occassionally poor</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>If you scroll with LinkedIn you might find a questionale post or two about how people don&rsquo;t like selling themselves, that we need to do better because of how more often than not we end up deflecting complements it with a self-deprecating counter-comment. I found there is a truth to them, and I&rsquo;m just a guilty in this.</p>
<p>Over last few years, I&rsquo;ve spend time on a dozen or so misceleneous mini-projects - from refrubruishing laptops, using ADB-S receivers for aircraft tracking or more recently developing home infrastructure (more info soon!). I&rsquo;ve dabbled in DXing, Linux and more academic subjects like probability theory to contributing on academic projects, besides a number of personal adventures. How do you know that I&rsquo;ve done any of that? <strong>You don&rsquo;t</strong> and this is where this blog will step in.</p>
<p>In short, this blog will aid me in sharing my thoughts on various topics related to tech and enginnering, but also serve as a noble platform the shameless self-promotion ranging from my experiences, to right up-to my current passion projects - including this very blog, and painstankly learning WebDev to develop it.</p>
<h2 id="something-stochastic">Something Stochastic?</h2>
<p>Like with a lot of projects, it took ages to come up with this name. The original idea was to create a joint blog with my partner that would span a range of topics. I would focus on astronomy and computer engineering, whereas she would specialises in like psychology or sustainability. In essence, a random but vagely academic and technophillic blog.</p>
<p>From the world of physics (and probability theorem), a <strong>stochastic</strong> process is one inherently random and unpredicable. It is often used to describe physical behavours of systems that are subject to fluctuations, chaos or other random variables. In thermodynamics, we can ascribe mathematical known as Equations of State (EoS) that describe the average behavour of gas (or other substances), for example particle velocities in a volume of gas that is proportional to temperature. The simplest EoS of is the Ideal Gas Equation, that assumes that movement of particles is inherently random, and therefore stochastic.</p>
<p>Wikipedia also defines stochastic as a property descibed by a random probability distribution. This makes sense in our example, as the of velocities of particles are also defined by a distribution. In essence, as we cannot predict velocities of individual gas particles, the observable macroscopic behavior of gases, such as pressure and temperature, can be described by statistical averages of those distributions for large numbers of particles.</p>
<p>This blog aimed to be stochastic but mostly centered around tech and science, similarly to a distribution. We ultimately decided to start our own projects, with me keeping this. The name stuck and will still be correct for stuff written here.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>This is indeed, 3rd iteration of this Hugo blog, this one being vagely functional. I will make a separate post about learning the ins and outs, but the primarly morale of this journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>WebDev is painful.</li>
<li>I prefer setting up infrastructure for projects like these.</li>
<li><strong>Do not over-engineer you websites</strong>. My other website, <a href="https://kiersz.dev">kiersz.dev</a>, is a single static page with some links. It does its job, just like this blog will.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>This does not aim to be a regular blog, but rather a curated collection of my activities and things I&rsquo;ve learned over the years.</p>
<p>I also set myself a goal of making a single video to showcase my homelab, and more importantly the process of creating it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
